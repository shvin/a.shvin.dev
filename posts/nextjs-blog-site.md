### [src/stack]
- https://github.com/shvin/a.shvin.dev
- https://a.shvin.dev
- typescript, next.js, tailwindcss

### Concept
I recently realized that expanding and modifying my [previous](https://ashvincodes-shvin.vercel.app/) portfolio site was complicated and messy despite utilizing reusable project and post components. 

In fact, I had noticed that the way I implemented my previous project component pages was extremely slow despite using static server rendering. With this new site, I wanted the site to be easily updated with my recent developments via Markdown (.md).

### Why Markdown?
The primary benefit to using Markdown is how easy it is to format text via its simple syntax. This makes it ideal and efficient for creating and modifying content easily without the use of extra software while also making it simple for me to import my .md files as blog posts with Metadata features.

### Metadata Features
Although you will not see the heading lines of the actual .md file, there exists a Metadata declaration that I have on every blog post that contains the title, subtitle, and date. By grabbing these details before displaying the post selection, I was able to create sufficient but detailed cards for each blog post while not showing the metadata headers inside the actual post page.

### Next.js(13) Utilization
- blog posts rendered static for speed
- unique post urls based on `/posts` file name
- global `layout.tsx` for navbar & footer
- `/app` directory instead of `/src`

### Extra Components
The site was styled using [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and features a few other packages and plugins to create the functionality.

- `@tailwindcss/typography` - frontend markdown viewing
- `gray-matter` - parsing blog post metadata section
- `markdown-to-jsx` - converting blog post content to rendered jsx

### In Development
Some of the features that are currently being developed include:
- Displaying blog posts by most recent date
- Metadata links that show on the blog post's card that points to demo/src
- proper colorscheme management for theme modification
- Metadata tagging system to show posts based on tag
